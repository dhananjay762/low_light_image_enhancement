# Low Light Image Enhancement and Denoising Using Deep Neural Networks

Images acquired in low-brightness conditions challenge human perception and many computer vision applications which lead to the low-visibility and various artifacts like contrast loss, and color distortion and hide many important features helpful to computer vision tasks. Deep learning methods have attained tremendous success in low-light image enhancement tasks but these are relatively slow and require intensive resources in terms of hardware. 

Therefore, we propose a fast and lightweight method for conducting dark image enhancement using only the lightness ‘L’ channel of Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL) color space instead of traditional 
RGB color space. This deep learning-based model comprises an autoencoder network to improve the illumination and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) based network to suppress the noise introduced due to the brightness enhancement. The single lightness channel of HSL attempts to reduce the learnable parameters and also avoids the over-enhancement and color distortion problems while retrieving the lost details. The proposed model is trained on LOL dataset and evaluated on some synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed methodology has shown competitive performance against the existing Light Channel Enhancement Network (LiCENt) model and witnessed better PSNR, SSIM and BRISQUE value for LOL dataset.
